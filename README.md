# Unified LLM Evaluation Pipeline

## Overview

This project provides a unified and automated pipeline for evaluating LLMs across a diverse set of benchmarks, including programming languages and mathematical reasoning. It is designed to simplify complex evaluation workflows by managing multiple Conda environments and centralizing all configurations into a single file.

The core of the pipeline is the main entry point `unified_evaluator.py`, which orchestrates the entire process based on the settings defined in `config.yml`.

## Features

  * **Centralized Configuration**: All settings—models, tasks, evaluation parameters, and paths—are managed in a single `config.yml` file for easy configuration and reproducibility.
  * **Automatic Environment Management**: The pipeline automatically checks if the required Conda environments (`harness_env`, `languages_env`, `goedelv2`) exist and creates them from their respective `.yml` files if they are missing.
  * **Multi-Environment Orchestration**: Intelligently switches between separate Conda environments to run different evaluation suites:
      * `harness_env`: Used for the LM Evaluation Harness (HumanEval) and Math Evaluation Harness (GSM8K).
      * `languages_env`: Used for custom evaluation of multiple programming languages (Go, Rust, Java, etc.).
      * `goedelv2`: Used for Lean 4 theorem proving (MiniF2F, MathOlympiadBench).
  * **Flexible Task Selection**: Easily specify which tasks to run for a given evaluation.
  * **Robust Execution**: Features a live scoreboard in the terminal, detailed CSV logging for all results, and a modular architecture that is resilient to single-task failures.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sherwin6180/unified-llm-eval
    cd unified-llm-eval
    ```

2.  **Ensure Conda is Installed:** This pipeline relies on Conda to manage environments.

    1. Install miniConda3: `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`
    2. Accept automatic initialization option for conda (works compatibly with Python venv)
    3. Accept Conda terms:
        ```bash
        # Term 1
        conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
        # Term 2
        conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r

        ```


3.  **Populate `vendor/` Directory:** Make sure the `HumanEval` and `math-evaluation-harness` codebases are correctly placed inside the `vendor/` directory.

4.  **(For MiniF2F/Theorem Proving) Set Up Lean 4 Environment:**
    
    If you plan to run theorem proving tasks (MiniF2F, MathOlympiadBench), you need to set up Lean 4 and Mathlib4. Run the setup script:
    
    ```bash
    bash scripts/setup_lean4.sh
    ```
    
    This script will automatically:
    - Clone Goedel-Prover-V2 into `vendor/goedel-prover/` (if not present)
    - Install elan (Lean version manager)
    - Install Lean 4.9.0
    - Build Mathlib4 (this may take 30-60 minutes on first run)
    
    **Note:** Building Mathlib4 requires ~10GB disk space and ~16GB RAM.

6.  **Set Up Conda Environments:** You have two options for creating the necessary Conda environments.

      * **Option 1: Automatic Creation (Recommended)**
        Simply run the main script. The pipeline is designed to automatically detect if `harness_env` and `languages_env` are missing and will create them for you using the `.yml` files in the `config/` directory. This is the easiest, hands-off approach.

        **Prerequisite**: Install `unified_evaluator.py`'s dependencies first:
        ```bash
        # Optional: set up venv
        python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment # or python

        # Required:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

        **Run the main script**
        ```bash
        python -m unified_llm_eval.unified_evaluator
        ```

      * **Option 2: Manual Creation**
        If you prefer to create the environments manually before the first run, execute the following commands in your terminal:

        ```bash
        # Create the environment for math and harness tasks
        conda env create -f config/harness_env.yml

        # Create the environment for multi-language evaluation
        conda env create -f config/languages_env.yml
        ```

7.  **Ensure Compilers are Installed (for Language Tasks)**
    To evaluate performance on compiled programming languages (e.g., Rust, Go, Java, C++), the corresponding compilers must be installed and accessible. The evaluation script works by compiling and running the code generated by the model.The current `languages_env.yml` is already configured with `rust`.

      1. Consider configuring compilers using Docker Containers or Podman
      2. Refer to MultiPL-E's repo: [MultiPL-E](https://github.com/nuprl/MultiPL-E)

8.  **Configure `config.yml`:** Before running, open `config.yml` and customize it for your evaluation run. See the detailed `Configuration` section below.

## Configuration (`config.yml`)

The `config.yml` file is the single source of truth for the pipeline. It is organized into four main sections:

```yaml
# 1. Settings for the specific evaluation run
run_settings:
  task_name: "Final Evaluation Run"
  description: "Evaluating deepseek-coder on all tasks."
  tasks_to_run:
    - "all"

# 2. List of models to evaluate
models:
  - model_name: "deepseek-coder-instruct"
    path: "/path/to/your/model"
    type: "instruct"
    description: "Base instructed model"
    location: "local"

# 3. General evaluation parameters
evaluation_settings:
  gpu_ids: "0,1"
  timeout_minutes: 30
  runs_per_eval: 1
  output_dir: "./evaluation_results"

# 4. Environment names and paths to vendored code
environment_config:
  harness_env: "harness_env" # DON'T CHANGE
  languages_env: "languages_env" # DON'T CHANGE
  math_harness_dir: "./vendor/math-evaluation-harness" # DON'T CHANGE
  language_eval_dir: "./vendor/HumanEval" # DON'T CHANGE
```

### `run_settings`

This section defines the scope of the current evaluation run.

  * `task_name`, `description`: Metadata for your run, used in logs and output filenames.
  * `tasks_to_run`: A list specifying which tasks to execute. This is a critical parameter.
      * You can specify individual tasks: `["rust", "humaneval"]`.
      * You can use `"all"` to run every supported task: `["all"]`.
      * **Available Tasks**:
          * **Harness (`harness_env`)**: `humaneval`, `gsm8k-cot`, `gsm8k-pal`
          * **Languages (`languages_env`)**: `python`, `cpp`, `java`, `cs`, `php`, `ts`, `js`, `sh`, `scala`, `rust`, `go`, `julia`, `rb`, `ocaml`
          * **Theorem Proving (`goedelv2`)**: `minif2f`, `minif2f-test`, `minif2f-valid`, `matholympiadbench`

### `models`

A list of model objects to be evaluated.

  * `model_name`: A unique identifier for the model.
  * `path`: The absolute path to the model's directory on your filesystem.
  * `type`: A category for the model (e.g., "instruct", "base"). Used for logging.
  * `description`: Optional descriptive text.
  * `location`: Local model ("local") or huggingface online model ("hf"). If location is not specified, default to "local".

### `evaluation_settings`

Parameters that control the evaluation process.

  * `gpu_ids`: A comma-separated string of GPU IDs to use (e.g., `"0,1,2,3"`).
  * `timeout_minutes`: The maximum time in minutes to allow for a single task before it times out. Default is 30.
  * `runs_per_eval`: How many times to repeat each evaluation task for a given model. The final CSV will include a `run_id` column.
  * `output_dir`: The directory where result CSVs and logs will be saved.
  * `temperature`: Ranging from 0 to 1.0
  * `batch size`: To set batch size for gsm8k, you first need to comment out `--use_vllm` in ./evaluators/harness_evaluator.py. Otherwise, vllm will set the batch size automatically. Also, you need to make sure you are only using 1 GPU if you want to try different batch sizes for gsm8k evaluations.

### `environment_config`

Defines the names of the Conda environments and paths to the evaluation scripts. Usually you don't need to change these.

  * `harness_env`, `languages_env`, `goedelv2_env`: The names of the Conda environments.
  * `math_harness_dir`, `language_eval_dir`, `goedel_prover_dir`: The paths of vendored code.

### `minif2f_settings` (for theorem proving tasks)

Settings specific to MiniF2F and other Lean 4 theorem proving evaluations:

  * `num_samples`: Number of proof samples per problem (Pass@N). Default: 32.
  * `num_samples_correction`: Samples per failed problem in correction rounds. Default: 2.
  * `num_cpus`: CPU cores for parallel Lean compilation. Default: 64.
  * `max_correction_rounds`: Self-correction rounds (0 = no correction). Default: 0.
  * `inference_handler`: Prompt format - `"dpskcot"`, `"dpsknoncot"`, or `"kiminacot"`. Default: `"dpskcot"`.
  * `temperature`: Sampling temperature for proof generation. Default: 1.0.
  * `max_model_len`: Maximum model sequence length. Default: 40960.

## Utility: Populate models list from a directory

Use the helper script to auto-generate the `models` section in `config.yml` from all immediate subdirectories under a root directory (non-recursive). The rest of the YAML remains unchanged.

```bash
python scripts/populate_models_from_dir.py \
  --root "/path/to/models/" \
  --config "config.yml" \
  --model-name-prefix "deepseek-coder-instruct" \
  --type "instruct" \
  --description "Auto-populated model"
```

Notes:
- Only immediate subdirectories are considered as model paths.
- The `models` list is replaced; other sections are preserved.
- `model_name` is constructed as `<prefix>-<leaf-dir>` (customize with `--model-name-prefix`).

## Usage

This project is an importable Python package named `unified_llm_eval`. The
checkout directory must be named `unified_llm_eval` (an importable name — no
hyphen) and its **parent** directory must be on `sys.path`. When embedded in
another project (e.g. as a subdirectory), run commands from that parent so the
package resolves; the entry points are invoked as modules with `-m`.

Once `config.yml` is configured, run the entire pipeline with:

```bash
# From the directory that contains the unified_llm_eval/ package
python -m unified_llm_eval.unified_evaluator
```

To use a different configuration file, specify it with the `--config` flag:

```bash
python -m unified_llm_eval.unified_evaluator --config config/my_special_run.yml
```

### Consuming it as a library

Other tools can drive evaluations directly through the public API without any
`sys.path` insertion or `UNIFIED_LLM_EVAL_ROOT` env var — vendored tool paths are
resolved relative to the package:

```python
from unified_llm_eval import EnvironmentManager, evaluate_model, default_env_config

env_config = default_env_config()          # vendor paths resolved to absolute
score = evaluate_model("/path/to/model", "coder", env_config=env_config)
```

`evaluate_model` accepts abstract task aliases (`"coder"`, `"math"`) as well as
registry keys, and returns the numeric score.

## MiniF2F / Theorem Proving Setup

The pipeline supports Lean 4 theorem proving evaluation using the Goedel-Prover-V2 framework. This requires additional setup beyond the standard Conda environment.

### Prerequisites

- Linux system
- Python 3.10
- At least 16GB RAM (for building Mathlib4)
- ~10GB disk space for Mathlib4

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Lean 4 and Mathlib4:**

   Run the setup script to install elan (Lean version manager), Lean 4.9.0, and build Mathlib4:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup_lean4.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Install elan if not present
   - Install Lean 4.9.0 (required version)
   - Build Mathlib4 in `vendor/goedel-prover/mathlib4/`

2. **Create the Conda environment:**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f config/goedelv2_env.yml
   ```

   Or let the pipeline create it automatically on first run.

3. **Configure `config.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   run_settings:
     tasks_to_run:
       - "minif2f"  # or "minif2f-test", "minif2f-valid"
   
   evaluation_settings:
     gpu_ids: "0,1,2,3"  # GPUs for vLLM inference
     minif2f_settings:
       num_samples: 32      # Pass@32
       num_cpus: 64         # For Lean compilation
       max_correction_rounds: 2  # Self-correction rounds
   ```

4. **Run the evaluation:**

   ```bash
   python -m unified_llm_eval.unified_evaluator
   ```

### Supported Models

The evaluator works with any model compatible with vLLM. Recommended models for theorem proving:

- [Goedel-Prover-V2-32B](https://huggingface.co/Goedel-LM/Goedel-Prover-V2-32B) - State-of-the-art
- [Goedel-Prover-V2-8B](https://huggingface.co/Goedel-LM/Goedel-Prover-V2-8B) - Smaller but still powerful
- [DeepSeek-Prover-V2](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B)

### Available Benchmarks

- `minif2f` / `minif2f-test`: MiniF2F test split (244 problems)
- `minif2f-valid`: MiniF2F validation split
- `matholympiadbench`: 360 IMO-level problems from MathOlympiadBench

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Lean 4:

1. Ensure `~/.elan/bin` is in your PATH
2. Verify Lean installation: `lean --version` should show v4.9.0
3. Rebuild Mathlib4: `cd vendor/goedel-prover/mathlib4 && lake build`
4. Check `lean_compiler/repl_scheduler.py` for path configurations

## Extensibility

Adding a new task is straightforward:

1.  Add the new task name to `tasks/task_registry.py`, mapping it to an environment and an `Evaluator` class.
2.  If the task requires new execution logic, create a new class in `evaluators/` that inherits from `BaseEvaluator`.
3.  If a new environment is needed, add its `.yml` file to `config/` and update the logic in `utils/env_manager.py`.

## Run heuristic and greedy algorithms

This framework includes scripts for running heuristic and greedy model merging, located in the `algorithms/` directory.

### 1. Configuration

**Note: ** Before you run the scripts, make sure your current environment has mergekit installed.

All settings for the algorithms are controlled by a single file: `algorithms/sandhi_config.yml`.

Before running, please configure the following keys in that file:

  * **`tasks`**: The abstract tasks to merge (e.g., `"coder"`, `"math"`).
  * **`models_to_merge`**: File paths to the base models you want to merge.
  * **`total_layers`**: The total number of layers in the models.
  * **`greedy_settings` / `heuristic_settings`**: Algorithm-specific settings like `layer_budget` and paths to your profiling data (e.g., `profiling_dir`).
  * **`tmp_dir`**: A path for temporary files, **remember to change to your own path**

### 2. How to Run

Execute the scripts from the directory that **contains** the `unified_llm_eval` package using the `python -m` command:

**To run the Greedy algorithm:**

```bash
python -m unified_llm_eval.algorithms.greedy
```

**To run the Heuristic algorithm:**

```bash
python -m unified_llm_eval.algorithms.heuristic
```

### 3. Outputs

All generated files, including temporary configs, logs, profiling scores, and the final merged models, will be saved in the `algorithms/outputs/` directory.
